1. Overview
Our prototype ensures safety and security at large gatherings by integrating AI-driven crowd control, offline multilingual first-aid guides, dynamic heatmaps with safe routes, and community-driven features. It focuses on predictive safety, real-time responsiveness, and inclusivity for attendees.
2. Problem & Solution
Problem Statement:
Large gatherings like Mahakumbh face challenges of crowd surges, stampedes, delayed emergency response, and lack of scalable, AI-based tools.
Solution:
An AI-powered, community-friendly platform with:
Crowd surge prediction and prevention.
Offline multilingual first-aid access.
Real-time navigation with heatmaps and safe routes.
Volunteer connect and essential services boards (food, water, lost & found).
3. Logic & Workflow
Data Collection: Crowd density sensors, user app data, volunteer input.
Processing: AI models predict surges, map real-time density, and generate alerts.
Output: Dynamic dashboards, heatmaps, and safety recommendations.
User Side: Mobile/web interface for SOS, navigation, first aid, and community services.
Admin Side: Dashboard for monitoring, alerts, lost & found, and emergency control.
4. Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js + Express
Database: MongoDB
AI/ML: Python (predictive models)
APIs/Services: Google Maps API, Firebase
Other Tools: Cloud hosting & authentication services
5. Future Scope
Integration with IoT sensors for real-time tracking.
Mobile app deployment with offline maps.
Advanced AI features like crowd mood analysis.
Multi-city scalability for large-scale adoption.
